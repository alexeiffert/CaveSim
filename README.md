# CaveSim v1.0

Welcome to CaveSim, the world's premier Java Swing based caveman simulator

# How to build and run

$  make
$  java CaveSim

Once the game has started and the cutscene is over, click "Survival Mode,"
which will start the fire minigame (to be changed in the future).


# Screenshots/

The screenshots/ directory contains screenshots of the work in progress.
The first two show parts of the text cutscene and the third shows the current
text menu (to be updated with a more attractive .png) The next show the currently
working minigame in which your character attempts to build a fire by using
the fire plow method. The next image shows the current 'about' screen. The
last screenshot shows part of the opening animation (that I missed in the previous
screenshots).

These are images vital to the game itself and should not be tampered with
