# Demo gameplay

The ImageFrame class acts as a multiplexer between minigame. Once the game has started and the cutscene 
is over, clicking "Survival Mode," will switch to FireMinigame class and immediately start the fire 
minigame (in future versions, this will bring the player to the home screen for a more interactive
experience). To play the fire minigame, simply use the left and right arrow keys to control the fire
plow--once the correct temperature is reached (up to the player to find out!), add kindling by pressing
the 'F' key. After the fire minigame is complete, ImageFrame will immediately start the cave
painting minigame. To play the painting minigame, complete the cave painting by drawing before time 
runs out. At the end of the time limit, the game will "score" your performance.

# Screenshots/

The screenshots/ directory contains screenshots of the work in progress.
The first two show parts of the text cutscene and the third shows the current
text menu (to be updated with a more attractive .png) The next show the currently
working minigame in which your character attempts to build a fire by using
the fire plow method. The next image shows the current 'about' screen. The
last screenshot shows part of the opening animation (that I missed in the previous
screenshots).

These are images vital to the game itself and should not be tampered with
